"""
    mfcc(signal::AbstractVector, window::Function = ones, windowsize = 400, overlap = 160, sr = 44100, numcep = 26)

Compute the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients of the given signal and return
an Array where each column contains the coefficients of a given frame obtained
from the stft.

**Parameters:**

`signal`: The signal on which the coefficients will be computed.

`window`: The window function to be applied on the signal by the STFT.

`windowsize`: The size of the STFT window.

`overlap`: The overlap of two adjacent windows of the STFT in samples.

`sr`: Sample rate of the signal.

`numcep`: The amount of cepstral coefficients to be extracted from the signal.
